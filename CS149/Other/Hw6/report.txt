Team We're Finally Graduating:

After looking at some examples of the select call, writing the code was fairly straightforward.
However, it took some time to understand what the purpose of the file descriptors were.
In addition, there we encountered a bug where the parent process would only print out child 1's messages.
This bug was due to the fact that we did not set the nfds variable to the correct value. In the end,
we simply just used FD_SETSIZE, and everything worked fine.
